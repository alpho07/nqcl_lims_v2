<info><![CDATA[

As well as being usable with DataTables, KeyTable can also be used with a plain HTML table. Please note that this ability is deprecated and will be removed in KeyTable 1.3.

This example shows KeyTable being initialised without any parameter, which instructs it to search for any table with the class `KeyTable` which will be used.
